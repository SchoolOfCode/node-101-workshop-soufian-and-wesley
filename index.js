// ðŸ‘‰ 2c. Create a function called describeItem, which should take in an item as a parameter (the argument handed to this function would be an item from our collection). The function should console.log a message according to how many of the item you have.

// If there's only one of the item in your collection, it should log "I have a name. Here's what I like about it: whatILike". If you have more than one of it, the message should log "I have count names. Here's what I like about them: whatILike".

// For example, the result of calling the describeItem function with the first item in our collection would be: "I have a School of Code mug. Here's what I like about it: It has my cute pixel character on it!"

// Call your function below where you've defined it, handing in the first item in myCollection.

// Now run the file again (using node index.js);
